# Agentic-Lesson-Material-Generation
*Note, this program is for my (small and humble) start up, and as such is still in use today. As a result, I can't freely share all the source code as they constitute currently in use proprietary material. However for showcase purposes I will be adding some snippets (if they aren't already added)! Along with some exmaples of material generation.*

## Basic Project Overview
A semi-supervised modular agentic lesson document generation program developed for Heart of Academy. After integrating this application, dedicated lesson materials creation time has decreased by ~93%, allowing more time to be allocated to careful curriculum and pedagogical development.
